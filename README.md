Learn chaotic German
====================

Creates a card deck for [AnkiDroid] containing computer-related technical
German, by taking the words used in [32C3 Subtities] and using the
definition found in [Wiktionary].

To run this code, make directories called `subtitle_files` and
`wiktionary_cache`. Place subtitle files (TXT files) in subtitle\_files
(it may be useful to use the [tar file containing subtitles]). Then run
`python main.py`.

This code outputs a tab-seperated file suitable for importing into the
[Anki desktop client].

A [ready-made .apkg file] is available
